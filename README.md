The Kisan Credit Score is our innovative approach to empower small scale farmers without a credit history, with a credit worthiness index to leverage loan schemes for farming activities from centralized banking institutions. We leverage the power of machine learning and aim to develop a robust credit worthiness index using predictive modeling.
Utilizing hyper-tuned neural ODEs for forecasting, random forest regressors for property-based farmer classification, and statistical models like weighted averages enhances our Kissan Credit Score model. This technology amalgamation optimizes accuracy, leveraging advanced forecasting and classification techniques, providing a robust and advantageous approach for precise credit score calculations.
Our ML-powered AWS Cloud web application for Kisan Credit Score is a groundbreaking solution that provides authorized personnel from various banks with a unified platform for assessing the creditworthiness of farmers. Unlike decentralized approaches, our application, hosted on AWS, offers cross-bank accessibility, ensuring consistent and fair credit evaluations. The platform features a centralized data repository, real-time updates, and robust scalability to accommodate the diverse needs of multiple financial institutions. With secure authentication and streamlined multi-bank access, our solution promotes collaboration and interoperability, fostering a standardized and equitable credit scoring system.
